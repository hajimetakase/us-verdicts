CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR 
THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT 
No. 16–712. Argued November 27, 2017—Decided April 24, 2018 
Inter partes review authorizes the United States Patent and Trade-
mark Office (PTO) to reconsider and cancel an already-issued patent 
claim in limited circumstances.  See 35 U. S. C. §§311–319.  Any per-
son who is not the owner of the patent may petition for review.  
§311(a).  If review is instituted, the process entitles the petitioner 
and the patent owner to conduct certain discovery, §316(a)(5); to file 
affidavits, declarations, and written memoranda, §316(a)(8); and to 
receive an oral hearing before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, 
§316(a)(10).  A final decision by the Board is subject to Federal Cir-
cuit review.  §§318, 319. Petitioner Oil States Energy Services, LLC, obtained a patent re-
lating to technology for protecting wellhead equipment used in hy-
draulic fracturing.  It sued respondent Greene’s Energy Group, LLC, 
in Federal District Court for infringement.  Greene’s Energy chal-
lenged the patent’s validity in the District Court and also petitioned 
the PTO for inter partes review.  Both proceedings progressed in par-
allel.  The District Court issued a claim-construction order favoring 
Oil States, while the Board issued a decision concluding that Oil 
States’ claims were unpatentable.  Oil States appealed to the Federal 
Circuit.  In addition to its patentability arguments, it challenged the 
constitutionality of inter partes review, arguing that actions to re-
voke a patent must be tried in an Article III court before a jury.  
While the case was pending, the Federal Circuit issued a decision in 
a separate case, rejecting the same constitutional arguments raised 
by Oil States.  The court then summarily affirmed the Board’s deci-
sion in this case. 
Held:

Syllabus
 1. Inter partes review does not violate Article III.  Pp. 5–17. (a) Under this Court’s precedents, Congress has significant lati-
tude to assign adjudication of public rights to entities other than Ar-
ticle III courts.  Executive Benefits Ins. Agency v. Arkison, 573 U. S. 
___, ___.  Inter partes review falls squarely within the public-rights 
doctrine.  The decision to grant a patent is a matter involving public 
rights.  Inter partes review is simply a reconsideration of that grant, 
and Congress has permissibly reserved the PTO’s authority to con-
duct that reconsideration.  Pp. 5–10.  (i) The grant of a patent falls within the public-rights doctrine.  
United States v. Duell, 172 U. S. 576, 582–583.  Granting a patent in-
volves a matter “arising between the government and others.”  Ex 
parte Bakelite Corp., 279 U. S. 438, 451.  Specifically, patents are 
“public franchises.” Seymour v. Osborne, 11 Wall. 516, 533.  Addi-
tionally, granting patents is one of “the constitutional functions” that 
can be carried out by “the executive or legislative departments” with-
out “ ‘judicial determination.’ ”  Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 50–
51.  Pp. 7–8.  (ii) Inter partes review involves the same basic matter as the 
grant of a patent.  It is “a second look at an earlier . . . grant,” Cuozzo 
Speed Technologies, LLC v. Lee, 579 U. S. ___, ___, and it involves the 
same interests as the original grant, see Duell, supra, at 586.  That 
inter partes review occurs after the patent has issued does not make 
a difference here.  Patents remain “subject to [the Board’s] authority” 
to cancel outside of an Article III court, Crowell, supra, at 50, and 
this Court has recognized that franchises can be qualified in this 
manner, see, e.g., Louisville Bridge Co. v. United States, 242 U. S. 
409, 421.  Pp. 8–10. (b) Three decisions that recognize patent rights as the “private 
property of the patentee,” United States v. American Bell Telephone 
Co., 128 U. S. 315, 370, do not contradict this conclusion.  See also 
McCormick Harvesting Machine Co. v. Aultman, 169 U. S. 606, 609; 
Brown v. Duchesne, 19 How. 183, 197.  Nor do they foreclose the kind 
of post-issuance administrative review that Congress has authorized 
here.  Those cases were decided under the Patent Act of 1870 and are 
best read as describing the statutory scheme that existed at that 
time.  Pp. 10–11. (c) Although patent validity was often decided in 18th-century 
English courts of law, that history does not establish that inter 
partes review violates the “general” principle that “Congress may not 
‘withdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its na-
ture, is the subject of a suit at the common law,” Stern v. Marshall, 
564 U. S. 462, 484.  Another means of canceling a patent at that 
time—a petition to the Privy Council to vacate a patent—closely re-

sembles inter partes review.  The parties have cited nothing to sug-
gest that the Framers were not aware of this common practice when 
writing the Patent Clause, or that they excluded the practice from 
the scope of the Clause.   Relatedly, the fact that American courts 
have traditionally adjudicated patent validity in this country does not 
mean that they must forever do so.  See post, at 8–10.  Historical 
practice is not decisive here because matters governed by the public-
rights doctrine may be assigned to the Legislature, the Executive, or 
the Judiciary.  Ex parte Bakelite Corp., supra, at 451.  That Congress 
chose the courts in the past does not foreclose its choice of the PTO 
today.  Pp. 12–15. (d) Finally, the similarities between the various procedures used 
in inter partes review and procedures typically used in courts does 
not lead to the conclusion that inter partes review violates Article III.  
This Court has never adopted a “looks like” test to determine if an 
adjudication has improperly occurred outside an Article III court.  
See, e.g., Williams v. United States, 289 U. S. 553, 563.  Pp. 15–16. (e) This holding is narrow.  The Court addresses only the consti-
tutionality of inter partes review and the precise constitutional chal-
lenges that Oil States raised here.  The decision should not be mis-
construed as suggesting that patents are not property for purposes of 
the Due Process Clause or the Takings Clause.  Pp. 16–17.2. Inter partes review does not violate the Seventh Amendment.  
When Congress properly assigns a matter to adjudication in a non-
Article III tribunal, “the Seventh Amendment poses no independent 
bar to the adjudication of that action by a nonjury factfinder.”  Gran-
financiera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, 52–53.  Thus, the rejection 
of Oil States’ Article III challenge also resolves its Seventh Amend-
ment challenge.  P. 17.

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 
APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT 
[April 24, 2018]JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, 35 U. S. C. §100 
et seq., establishes a process called “inter partes review.”  
Under that process, the United States Patent and Trade-
mark Office (PTO) is authorized to reconsider and to 
cancel an issued patent claim in limited circumstances.  In 
this case, we address whether inter partes review violates 
Article III or the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution.  
We hold that it violates neither. 
I 
AUnder the Patent Act, the PTO is “responsible for the 
granting and issuing of patents.”  35 U. S. C. §2(a)(1).  
When an inventor applies for a patent, an examiner re-
views the proposed claims and the prior art to determine if 
the claims meet the statutory requirements.  See §§112, 
131.  Those requirements include utility, novelty, and 
nonobviousness based on the prior art.  §§101, 102, 103.  
The Director of the PTO then approves or rejects the 
application.  See §§131, 132(a).  An applicant can seek 
judicial review of a final rejection.  §§141(a), 145. 
2 OIL STATES ENERGY SERVICES, LLC v. GREENE’SENERGY GROUP, LLC 
Opinion of the Court 
BOver the last several decades, Congress has created 
administrative processes that authorize the PTO to recon-
sider and cancel patent claims that were wrongly issued.  
In 1980, Congress established “ex parte reexamination,” 
which still exists today.  See Act To Amend the Patent and 
Trademark Laws, 35 U. S. C. §301 et seq.  Ex parte re- 
examination permits “[a]ny person at any time” to “file a 
request for reexamination.”  §302.  If the Director deter-
mines that there is “a substantial new question of patent-
ability” for “any claim of the patent,” the PTO can reex-
amine the patent.  §§303(a), 304.  The reexamination 
process follows the same procedures as the initial exami-
nation.  §305.In 1999, Congress added a procedure called “inter partes 
reexamination.”  See American Inventors Protection Act, 
§§4601–4608, 113 Stat. 1501A–567 to 1501A–572.  Under 
this procedure, any person could file a request for reexam-
ination.  35 U. S. C. §311(a) (2006 ed.).  The Director 
would determine if the request raised “a substantial new 
question of patentability affecting any claim of the patent” 
and, if so, commence a reexamination.  §§312(a), 313 (2006 
ed.).  The reexamination would follow the general proce-
dures for initial examination, but would allow the third-
party requester and the patent owner to participate in a 
limited manner by filing responses and replies.  §§314(a), 
(b) (2006 ed.).  Inter partes reexamination was phased out 
when the America Invents Act went into effect in 2012.  
See §6, 125 Stat. 299–305. 
CThe America Invents Act replaced inter partes reexami-
nation with inter partes review, the procedure at issue 
here.  See id., at 299.  Any person other than the patent 
owner can file a petition for inter partes review.  35 
U. S. C. §311(a) (2012 ed.).  The petition can request can-

Opinion of the Court 
cellation of “1 or more claims of a patent” on the grounds 
that the claim fails the novelty or nonobviousness stand-
ards for patentability.  §311(b).  The challenges must be 
made “only on the basis of prior art consisting of patents 
or printed publications.”  Ibid.  If a petition is filed, the 
patent owner has the right to file a preliminary response 
explaining why inter partes review should not be insti- 
tuted.  §313.Before he can institute inter partes review, the Director 
must determine “that there is a reasonable likelihood that 
the petitioner would prevail with respect to at least 1 of 
the claims challenged.”  §314(a).  The decision whether to 
institute inter partes review is committed to the Director’s 
discretion.  See Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC v. Lee, 
579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 9).  The Director’s 
decision is “final and nonappealable.”  §314(d).1Once inter partes review is instituted, the Patent Trial 
and Appeal Board—an adjudicatory body within the PTO 
created to conduct inter partes review—examines the 
patent’s validity.  See 35 U. S. C. §§6, 316(c).  The Board 
sits in three-member panels of administrative patent 
judges.  See §6(c).  During the inter partes review, the 
petitioner and the patent owner are entitled to certain 
discovery, §316(a)(5); to file affidavits, declarations, and 
written memoranda, §316(a)(8); and to receive an oral 
hearing before the Board, §316(a)(10).  The petitioner has 
the burden of proving unpatentability by a preponderance 
of the evidence.  §316(e).  The owner can file a motion to 
amend the patent by voluntarily canceling a claim or by 
“propos[ing] a reasonable number of substitute claims.”  
§316(d)(1)(B).  The owner can also settle with the peti- 
tioner by filing a written agreement prior to the Board’s final 
decision, which terminates the proceedings with respect to

Opinion of the Court 
that petitioner.  §317.  If the settlement results in no 
petitioner remaining in the inter partes review, the Board 
can terminate the proceeding or issue a final written 
decision.  §317(a).If the proceeding does not terminate, the Board must 
issue a final written decision no later than a year after it 
notices the institution of inter partes review, but that 
deadline can be extended up to six months for good cause.  
§§316(a)(11), 318(a).  If the Board’s decision becomes final, 
the Director must “issue and publish a certificate.”  
§318(b).  The certificate cancels patent claims “finally 
determined to be unpatentable,” confirms patent claims 
“determined to be patentable,” and incorporates into the 
patent “any new or amended claim determined to be pa-
tentable.”  Ibid.A party dissatisfied with the Board’s decision can seek 
judicial review in the Court of Appeals for the Federal 
Circuit.  §319.  Any party to the inter partes review can be 
a party in the Federal Circuit.  Ibid.  The Director can 
intervene to defend the Board’s decision, even if no party 
does.  See §143; Cuozzo, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 15).  
When reviewing the Board’s decision, the Federal Circuit 
assesses “the Board’s compliance with governing legal 
standards de novo and its underlying factual determina-
tions for substantial evidence.”  Randall Mfg. v. Rea, 733 
F. 3d 1355, 1362 (CA Fed. 2013). 
IIPetitioner Oil States Energy Services, LLC, and re-
spondent Greene’s Energy Group, LLC, are both oilfield 
services companies.  In 2001, Oil States obtained a patent 
relating to an apparatus and method for protecting well-
head equipment used in hydraulic fracturing.  In 2012, Oil 
States sued Greene’s Energy in Federal District Court for 
infringing that patent.  Greene’s Energy responded by 
challenging the patent’s validity.  Near the close of discov-
 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018) 5
Opinion of the Court 
ery, Greene’s Energy also petitioned the Board to institute 
inter partes review.  It argued that two of the patent’s 
claims were unpatentable because they were anticipated 
by prior art not mentioned by Oil States in its original 
patent application.  Oil States filed a response opposing 
review.  The Board found that Greene’s Energy had estab-
lished a reasonable likelihood that the two claims were 
unpatentable and, thus, instituted inter partes review.The proceedings before the District Court and the Board 
progressed in parallel.  In June 2014, the District Court 
issued a claim-construction order.  The order construed 
the challenged claims in a way that foreclosed Greene’s 
Energy’s arguments about the prior art.  But a few months 
later, the Board issued a final written decision concluding 
that the claims were unpatentable.  The Board acknowl-
edged the District Court’s contrary decision, but nonethe-
less concluded that the claims were anticipated by the 
prior art.Oil States sought review in the Federal Circuit.  In 
addition to its arguments about patentability, Oil States 
challenged the constitutionality of inter partes review.  
Specifically, it argued that actions to revoke a patent must 
be tried in an Article III court before a jury.  While Oil 
States’ case was pending, the Federal Circuit issued an 
opinion in a different case, rejecting the same constitu-
tional arguments.  MCM Portfolio LLC v. Hewlett-Packard 
Co., 812 F. 3d 1284, 1288–1293 (2015).  The Federal Cir-
cuit summarily affirmed the Board’s decision in this case.  
639 Fed. Appx. 639 (2016).We granted certiorari to determine whether inter partes 
review violates Article III or the Seventh Amendment.  
582 U. S. ___ (2017).  We address each issue in turn. 
IIIArticle III vests the judicial power of the United States 
“in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the 
6 OIL STATES ENERGY SERVICES, LLC v. GREENE’SENERGY GROUP, LLC 
Opinion of the Court 
Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.”  §1.  
Consequently, Congress cannot “confer the Government’s 
‘judicial Power’ on entities outside Article III.”  Stern v. 
Marshall, 564 U. S. 462, 484 (2011).  When determining 
whether a proceeding involves an exercise of Article III 
judicial power, this Court’s precedents have distinguished 
between “public rights” and “private rights.”  Executive 
Benefits Ins. Agency v. Arkison, 573 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) 
(slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Those 
precedents have given Congress significant latitude to 
assign adjudication of public rights to entities other than 
Article III courts.  See ibid.; Stern, supra, at 488–492.This Court has not “definitively explained” the distinc-
tion between public and private rights, Northern Pipeline 
Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 69 
(1982), and its precedents applying the public-rights doc-
trine have “not been entirely consistent,” Stern, 564 U. S., 
at 488.  But this case does not require us to add to the 
“various formulations” of the public-rights doctrine.  Ibid.  
Our precedents have recognized that the doctrine covers 
matters “which arise between the Government and per-
sons subject to its authority in connection with the per-
formance of the constitutional functions of the executive or 
legislative departments.”  Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 
50 (1932).  In other words, the public-rights doctrine ap-
plies to matters “ ‘arising between the government and 
others, which from their nature do not require judicial 
determination and yet are susceptible of it.’ ”  Ibid. (quot-
ing Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 279 U. S. 438, 451 (1929)).  
Inter partes review involves one such matter: reconsid- 
eration of the Government’s decision to grant a public 
franchise. 
AInter partes review falls squarely within the public-
rights doctrine.  This Court has recognized, and the par-

Opinion of the Court 
ties do not dispute, that the decision to grant a patent is a 
matter involving public rights—specifically, the grant of a 
public franchise.  Inter partes review is simply a reconsid-
eration of that grant, and Congress has permissibly re-
served the PTO’s authority to conduct that reconsidera-
tion.  Thus, the PTO can do so without violating Article 
III. 
1This Court has long recognized that the grant of a pa-
tent is a “ ‘matte[r] involving public rights.’ ”  United States 
v. Duell, 172 U. S. 576, 582–583 (1899) (quoting Murray’s 
Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 
284 (1856)).  It has the key features to fall within this 
Court’s longstanding formulation of the public-rights 
doctrine.Ab initio, the grant of a patent involves a matter “aris-
ing between the government and others.”  Ex parte Bake-
lite Corp., supra, at 451.  As this Court has long recog-
nized, the grant of a patent is a matter between “ ‘the 
public, who are the grantors, and . . . the patentee.’ ”  
Duell, supra, at 586 (quoting Butterworth v. United States 
ex rel. Hoe, 112 U. S. 50, 59 (1884)).  By “issuing patents,” 
the PTO “take[s] from the public rights of immense value, 
and bestow[s] them upon the patentee.”  United States v. 
American Bell Telephone Co., 128 U. S. 315, 370 (1888).  
Specifically, patents are “public franchises” that the Gov-
ernment grants “to the inventors of new and useful im-
provements.”  Seymour v. Osborne, 11 Wall. 516, 533 
(1871); accord, Pfaff v. Wells Electronics, Inc., 525 U. S. 55, 
63–64 (1998).  The franchise gives the patent owner “the 
right to exclude others from making, using, offering for 
sale, or selling the invention throughout the United 
States.”  35 U. S. C. §154(a)(1).  That right “did not exist 
at common law.”  Gayler v. Wilder, 10 How. 477, 494 
(1851).  Rather, it is a “creature of statute law.”  Crown 
8 OIL STATES ENERGY SERVICES, LLC v. GREENE’SENERGY GROUP, LLC 
Opinion of the Court 
Die & Tool Co. v. Nye Tool & Machine Works, 261 U. S. 24, 
40 (1923).Additionally, granting patents is one of “the constitu-
tional functions” that can be carried out by “the executive 
or legislative departments” without “ ‘judicial determina-
tion.’ ”  Crowell, supra, at 50–51 (quoting Ex parte Bakelite 
Corp., supra, at 452).  Article I gives Congress the power 
“[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by 
securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the 
exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discover-
ies.”  §8, cl. 8.  Congress can grant patents itself by stat-
ute.  See, e.g., Bloomer v. McQuewan, 14 How. 539, 548–
550 (1853).  And, from the founding to today, Congress has 
authorized the Executive Branch to grant patents that 
meet the statutory requirements for patentability.  See 35 
U. S. C. §§2(a)(1), 151; see also Act of July 8, 1870, §31, 16 
Stat. 202; Act of July 4, 1836, §7, 5 Stat. 119–120; Act of 
Apr. 10, 1790, ch. 7, §1, 1 Stat. 109–110.  When the PTO 
“adjudicate[s] the patentability of inventions,” it is “exer-
cising the executive power.”  Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 
U. S. 868, 910 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and 
concurring in judgment) (emphasis deleted).Accordingly, the determination to grant a patent is a 
“matte[r] involving public rights.”  Murray’s Lessee, supra, 
at 284.  It need not be adjudicated in Article III court. 
2Inter partes review involves the same basic matter as 
the grant of a patent.  So it, too, falls on the public-rights 
side of the line.Inter partes review is “a second look at an earlier ad-
ministrative grant of a patent.”  Cuozzo, 579 U. S., at ___ 
(slip op., at 16).  The Board considers the same statutory 
requirements that the PTO considered when granting the 
patent.  See 35 U. S. C. §311(b).  Those statutory require-
ments prevent the “issuance of patents whose effects areCite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018) 9
Opinion of the Court 
to remove existent knowledge from the public domain.”  
Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1, 6 
(1966).  So, like the PTO’s initial review, the Board’s inter 
partes review protects “the public’s paramount interest in 
seeing that patent monopolies are kept within their legit-
imate scope,” Cuozzo, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 16) (inter-
nal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  Thus, inter 
partes review involves the same interests as the determi-
nation to grant a patent in the first instance.  See Duell, 
supra, at 586.The primary distinction between inter partes review 
and the initial grant of a patent is that inter partes review 
occurs after the patent has issued.  But that distinction 
does not make a difference here.  Patent claims are granted 
subject to the qualification that the PTO has “the au- 
thority to reexamine—and perhaps cancel—a patent 
claim” in an inter partes review.  See Cuozzo, supra, at ___ 
(slip op., at 3).  Patents thus remain “subject to [the 
Board’s] authority” to cancel outside of an Article III court.  
Crowell, 285 U. S., at 50.This Court has recognized that franchises can be quali-
fied in this manner.  For example, Congress can grant a 
franchise that permits a company to erect a toll bridge, 
but qualify the grant by reserving its authority to revoke 
or amend the franchise.  See, e.g., Louisville Bridge Co. v. 
United States, 242 U. S. 409, 421 (1917) (collecting cases).  
Even after the bridge is built, the Government can exer-
cise its reserved authority through legislation or an ad-
ministrative proceeding.  See, e.g., id., at 420–421; Hanni-
bal Bridge Co. v. United States, 221 U. S. 194, 205 (1911); 
Bridge Co. v. United States, 105 U. S. 470, 478–482 (1882).  
The same is true for franchises that permit companies to 
build railroads or telegraph lines.  See, e.g., United States 
v. Union Pacific R. Co., 160 U. S. 1, 24–25, 37–38 (1895).Thus, the public-rights doctrine covers the matter re-
solved in inter partes review.  The Constitution does not

Opinion of the Court 
prohibit the Board from resolving it outside of an Article 
III court. 
BOil States challenges this conclusion, citing three deci-
sions that recognize patent rights as the “private property 
of the patentee.”  American Bell Telephone Co., 128 U. S., 
at 370; see also McCormick Harvesting Machine Co. v. 
Aultman, 169 U. S. 606, 609 (1898) (“[A granted patent] 
has become the property of the patentee”); Brown v. Du- 
chesne, 19 How. 183, 197 (1857) (“[T]he rights of a party 
under a patent are his private property”).  But those cases 
do not contradict our conclusion.Patents convey only a specific form of property right—a 
public franchise.  See Pfaff, 525 U. S., at 63–64.  And 
patents are “entitled to protection as any other property, 
consisting of a franchise.”  Seymour, 11 Wall. at 533 (em-
phasis added).  As a public franchise, a patent can confer 
only the rights that “the statute prescribes.”  Gayler, 
supra, at 494; Wheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet. 591, 663–664 
(1834) (noting that Congress has “the power to prescribe 
the conditions on which such right shall be enjoyed”).  It is 
noteworthy that one of the precedents cited by Oil States 
acknowledges that the patentee’s rights are “derived 
altogether” from statutes, “are to be regulated and meas-
ured by these laws, and cannot go beyond them.”  Brown, 
supra, at 195.2One such regulation is inter partes review.  See Cuozzo, 
—————— 
2 This Court has also recognized this dynamic for state-issued fran-
chises.  For instance, States often reserve the right to alter or revoke a 
corporate charter either “in the act of incorporation or in some general 
law of the State which was in operation at the time the charter was 
granted.”  Pennsylvania College Cases, 13 Wall. 190, 214, and n. † 
(1872).  That reservation remains effective even after the corporation 
comes into existence, and such alterations do not offend the Contracts 
Clause of Article I, §10.  See Pennsylvania College Cases, supra, at 212–
214; e.g., Miller v. State, 15 Wall. 478, 488–489 (1873).Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018) 11
Opinion of the Court 
579 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).  The Patent Act provides 
that, “[s]ubject to the provisions of this title, patents shall 
have the attributes of personal property.”  35 U. S. C. 
§261.  This provision qualifies any property rights that a 
patent owner has in an issued patent, subjecting them to 
the express provisions of the Patent Act.  See eBay Inc. v. 
MercExchange, L. L. C., 547 U. S. 388, 392 (2006).  Those 
provisions include inter partes review.  See §§311–319.Nor do the precedents that Oil States cites foreclose the 
kind of post-issuance administrative review that Congress 
has authorized here.  To be sure, two of the cases make 
broad declarations that “[t]he only authority competent to 
set a patent aside, or to annul it, or to correct it for any 
reason whatever, is vested in the courts of the United 
States, and not in the department which issued the pat- 
ent.”  McCormick Harvesting Machine Co., supra, at 609; 
accord, American Bell Telephone Co., 128 U. S., at 364.  
But those cases were decided under the Patent Act of 
1870.  See id., at 371; McCormick Harvesting Machine Co., 
supra, at 611.  That version of the Patent Act did not 
include any provision for post-issuance administrative 
review.  Those precedents, then, are best read as a de-
scription of the statutory scheme that existed at that time.  
They do not resolve Congress’ authority under the Consti-
tution to establish a different scheme.3

3 The dissent points to McCormick’s statement that the Patent Office 
Commissioner could not invalidate the patent at issue because it would 
“ ‘deprive the applicant of his property without due process of law, and 
would be in fact an invasion of the judicial branch.’ ”  Post, at 10 (quot-
ing McCormick Harvesting Machine Co. v. Aultman, 169 U. S. 606, 612 
(1898)).  But that statement followed naturally from the Court’s deter-
mination that, under the Patent Act of 1870, the Commissioner “was 
functus officio” and “had no power to revoke, cancel, or annul” the 
patent at issue.  169 U. S., at 611–612. 
Nor is it significant that the McCormick Court “equated invention 
patents with land patents.”  Post, at 10.  McCormick itself makes clear 
that the analogy between the two depended on the particulars of the 
12 OIL STATES ENERGY SERVICES, LLC v. GREENE’SENERGY GROUP, LLC 
Opinion of the Court 
COil States and the dissent contend that inter partes 
review violates the “general” principle that “Congress may 
not ‘withdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which, 
from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law, 
or in equity, or admiralty.’ ”  Stern, 564 U. S., at 484 (quot-
ing Murray’s Lessee, 18 How., at 284).  They argue that 
this is so because patent validity was often decided in 
English courts of law in the 18th century.  For example, if 
a patent owner brought an infringement action, the de-
fendant could challenge the validity of the patent as an 
affirmative defense.  See Lemley, Why Do Juries Decide If 
Patents Are Valid? 99 Va. L. Rev. 1673, 1682, 1685–1686, 
and n. 52 (2013).  Or, an individual could challenge the 
validity of a patent by filing a writ of scire facias in the 
Court of Chancery, which would sit as a law court when 
adjudicating the writ.  See id., at 1683–1685, and n. 44; 
Bottomley, Patent Cases in the Court of Chancery, 1714–
58, 35 J. Legal Hist. 27, 36–37, 41–43 (2014).But this history does not establish that patent validity 
is a matter that, “from its nature,” must be decided by a 
court.  Stern, supra, at 484 (quoting Murray’s Lessee, 
supra, at 284).  The aforementioned proceedings were 
between private parties.  But there was another means of 
—————— 
Patent Act of 1870.  See 169 U. S., at 609–610.  Modern invention 
patents, by contrast, are meaningfully different from land patents.  The 
land-patent cases invoked by the dissent involved a “transaction [in 
which] ‘all authority or control’ over the lands has passed from ‘the 
Executive Department.’ ”  Boesche v. Udall, 373 U. S. 472, 477 (1963) 
(quoting Moore v. Robbins, 96 U. S. 530, 533 (1878)).  Their holdings do 
not apply when “the Government continues to possess some measure of 
control over” the right in question.  Boesche, 373 U. S., at 477; see id., 
at 477–478 (affirming administrative cancellations of public-land 
leases).  And that is true of modern invention patents under the current 
Patent Act, which gives the PTO continuing authority to review and 
potentially cancel patents after they are issued.  See 35 U. S. C. §§261, 
311–319.Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018) 13
Opinion of the Court 
canceling a patent in 18th-century England, which more 
closely resembles inter partes review: a petition to the 
Privy Council to vacate a patent.  See Lemley, supra, at 
1681–1682; Hulme, Privy Council Law and Practice of 
Letters Patent for Invention From the Restoration to 1794, 
33 L. Q. Rev. 63 (1917).  The Privy Council was composed 
of the Crown’s advisers.  Lemley, supra, at 1681.  From 
the 17th through the 20th centuries, English patents had 
a standard revocation clause that permitted six or more 
Privy Counsellors to declare a patent void if they deter-
mined the invention was contrary to law, “prejudicial” or 
“inconvenient,” not new, or not invented by the patent 
owner.  See 11 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 
426–427, and n. 6 (1938); Davies, The Early History of the 
Patent Specification, 50 L. Q. Rev. 86, 102–106 (1934).  
Individuals could petition the Council to revoke a patent, 
and the petition was referred to the Attorney General.  
The Attorney General examined the petition, considered 
affidavits from the petitioner and patent owner, and heard 
from counsel.  See, e.g., Bull v. Lydall, PC2/81, pp. 180–
181 (1706).  Depending on the Attorney General’s conclu-
sion, the Council would either void the patent or dismiss 
the petition.  See, e.g., Darby v. Betton, PC2/99, pp. 358–
359 (1745–1746) (voiding the patent); Baker v. James, 
PC2/103, pp. 320–321, 346–347 (1752) (dismissing the 
petition).The Privy Council was a prominent feature of the Eng-
lish system.  It had exclusive authority to revoke patents 
until 1753, and after that, it had concurrent jurisdiction 
with the courts.  See Hulme, 33 L. Q. Rev., at 189–191, 
193–194.  The Privy Council continued to consider revoca-
tion claims and to revoke patents throughout the 18th 
century.  Its last revocation was in 1779.  See id., at 192–
193.  It considered, but did not act on, revocation claims in 
1782, 1794, and 1810.  See ibid.; Board of Ordinance v. 
Parr, PC1/3919 (1810). 
14 OIL STATES ENERGY SERVICES, LLC v. GREENE’SENERGY GROUP, LLC 
Opinion of the CourtThe Patent Clause in our Constitution “was written 
against the backdrop” of the English system.  Graham, 
383 U. S., at 5.  Based on the practice of the Privy Council, 
it was well understood at the founding that a patent sys-
tem could include a practice of granting patents subject to 
potential cancellation in the executive proceeding of the 
Privy Council.  The parties have cited nothing in the text 
or history of the Patent Clause or Article III to suggest 
that the Framers were not aware of this common practice.  
Nor is there any reason to think they excluded this prac-
tice during their deliberations.  And this Court has recog-
nized that, “[w]ithin the scope established by the Constitu-
tion, Congress may set out conditions and tests for 
patentability.”  Id., at 6.  We conclude that inter partes 
review is one of those conditions.4For similar reasons, we disagree with the dissent’s 
assumption that, because courts have traditionally adjudi-
cated patent validity in this country, courts must forever 
continue to do so.  See post, at 8–10.  Historical practice is 
not decisive here because matters governed by the public-
rights doctrine “from their nature” can be resolved in 
multiple ways: Congress can “reserve to itself the power to 
—————— 
4 Oil States also suggests that inter partes review could be an uncon-
stitutional condition because it conditions the benefit of a patent on 
accepting the possibility of inter partes review.  Cf. Koontz v. St. Johns 
River Water Management Dist., 570 U. S. 595, 604 (2013) (“[T]he 
government may not deny a benefit to a person because he exercises a 
constitutional right” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Even assum-
ing a patent is a “benefit” for purposes of the unconstitutional-
conditions doctrine, that doctrine does not apply here.  The doctrine 
prevents the Government from using conditions “to produce a result 
which it could not command directly.”  Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 
593, 597 (1972) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  
But inter partes review is consistent with Article III, see Part III–A, 
supra, and falls within Congress’ Article I authority, see Part III–C, 
supra, so it is something Congress can “command directly,” Perry, 
supra, at 597.Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018) 15
Opinion of the Court 
decide,” “delegate that power to executive officers,” or 
“commit it to judicial tribunals.”  Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 
279 U. S., at 451.  That Congress chose the courts in the 
past does not foreclose its choice of the PTO today. 
DFinally, Oil States argues that inter partes review vio-
lates Article III because it shares “every salient character-
istic associated with the exercise of the judicial power.”  
Brief for Petitioner 20.  Oil States highlights various 
procedures used in inter partes review: motion practice 
before the Board; discovery, depositions, and cross-
examination of witnesses; introduction of evidence and 
objections based on the Federal Rules of Evidence; and an 
adversarial hearing before the Board.  See 35 U. S. C. 
§316(a); 77 Fed. Reg. 48758, 48761–48763 (2012).  Similarly, 
Oil States cites PTO regulations that use terms typically 
associated with courts—calling the hearing a “trial,” id., 
at 48758; the Board members “judges,” id., at 48763; and 
the Board’s final decision a “judgment,” id., at 48761, 
48766–48767.But this Court has never adopted a “looks like” test to 
determine if an adjudication has improperly occurred 
outside of an Article III court.  The fact that an agency 
uses court-like procedures does not necessarily mean it is 
exercising the judicial power.  See Freytag, 501 U. S., at 
910 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  This Court has rejected the 
notion that a tribunal exercises Article III judicial power 
simply because it is “called a court and its decisions called 
judgments.”  Williams v. United States, 289 U. S. 553, 563 
(1933).  Nor does the fact that an administrative adjudica-
tion is final and binding on an individual who acquiesces 
in the result necessarily make it an exercise of the judicial 
power.  See, e.g., Murray’s Lessee, 18 How., at 280–281 
(permitting the Treasury Department to conduct “final 
and binding” audits outside of an Article III court).  Al- 
16 OIL STATES ENERGY SERVICES, LLC v. GREENE’SENERGY GROUP, LLC 
Opinion of the Court 
though inter partes review includes some of the features of 
adversarial litigation, it does not make any binding de-
termination regarding “the liability of [Greene’s Energy] to 
[Oil States] under the law as defined.”  Crowell, 285 U. S., 
at 51.  It remains a matter involving public rights, one 
“between the government and others, which from [its] 
nature do[es] not require judicial determination.”  Ex parte 
Bakelite Corp., 279 U. S., at 451.5 
EWe emphasize the narrowness of our holding.  We ad-
dress the constitutionality of inter partes review only.  We 
do not address whether other patent matters, such as 
infringement actions, can be heard in a non-Article III 
forum.  And because the Patent Act provides for judicial 
review by the Federal Circuit, see 35 U. S. C. §319, we 
need not consider whether inter partes review would be 
constitutional “without any sort of intervention by a court 
at any stage of the proceedings,” Atlas Roofing Co. v. 
Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm’n, 430 U. S. 
442, 455, n. 13 (1977).  Moreover, we address only the 
precise constitutional challenges that Oil States raised 
—————— 
5 Oil States also points out that inter partes review “is initiated by 
private parties and implicates no waiver of sovereign immunity.”  Brief 
for Petitioner 30–31.  But neither of those features takes inter partes 
review outside of the public-rights doctrine.  That much is clear from 
United States v. Duell, 172 U. S. 576 (1899), which held that the doc-
trine covers interference proceedings—a procedure to “determin[e] 
which of two claimants is entitled to a patent”—even though interfer-
ence proceedings were initiated by “ ‘private interests compet[ing] for 
preference’ ” and did not involve a waiver of sovereign immunity.  Id., at 
582, 586 (quoting Butterworth v. United States ex rel. Hoe, 112 U. S. 50, 
59 (1884)).  Also, inter partes review is not initiated by private parties 
in the way that a common-law cause of action is.  To be sure, a private 
party files the petition for review.  35 U. S. C. §311(a).  But the decision 
to institute review is made by the Director and committed to his unre-
viewable discretion.  See Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC v. Lee, 579 
U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 9).Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018) 17
Opinion of the Court 
here.  Oil States does not challenge the retroactive appli-
cation of inter partes review, even though that procedure 
was not in place when its patent issued.  Nor has Oil 
States raised a due process challenge.  Finally, our deci-
sion should not be misconstrued as suggesting that pa-
tents are not property for purposes of the Due Process 
Clause or the Takings Clause.  See, e.g., Florida Prepaid 
Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 
527 U. S. 627, 642 (1999); James v. Campbell, 104 U. S. 
356, 358 (1882). 
IVIn addition to Article III, Oil States challenges inter 
partes review under the Seventh Amendment.  The Sev-
enth Amendment preserves the “right of trial by jury” in 
“Suits at common law, where the value in controversy 
shall exceed twenty dollars.”  This Court’s precedents 
establish that, when Congress properly assigns a matter 
to adjudication in a non-Article III tribunal, “the Seventh 
Amendment poses no independent bar to the adjudication 
of that action by a nonjury factfinder.”  Granfinanciera, 
S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, 53–54 (1989); accord, Atlas 
Roofing Co., supra, at 450–455.  No party challenges or 
attempts to distinguish those precedents.  Thus, our rejec-
tion of Oil States’ Article III challenge also resolves its 
Seventh Amendment challenge.  Because inter partes 
review is a matter that Congress can properly assign to 
the PTO, a jury is not necessary in these proceedings. 
VBecause inter partes review does not violate Article III 
or the Seventh Amendment, we affirm the judgment of the 
Court of Appeals. 
It is so ordered.Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018) 1

[April 24, 2018]JUSTICE GORSUCH, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE 
joins, dissenting.After much hard work and no little investment you 
devise something you think truly novel.  Then you endure 
the further cost and effort of applying for a patent, devot-
ing maybe $30,000 and two years to that process alone.  At 
the end of it all, the Patent Office agrees your invention is 
novel and issues a patent.  The patent affords you exclu-
sive rights to the fruits of your labor for two decades.  But 
what happens if someone later emerges from the wood-
work, arguing that it was all a mistake and your patent 
should be canceled?  Can a political appointee and his 
administrative agents, instead of an independent judge, 
resolve the dispute?  The Court says yes.  Respectfully, I 
disagree.We sometimes take it for granted today that independ-
ent judges will hear our cases and controversies.  But it 
wasn’t always so.  Before the Revolution, colonial judges 
depended on the crown for their tenure and salary and 
often enough their decisions followed their interests.  The 
problem was so serious that the founders cited it in their 
Declaration of Independence (see ¶11).  Once free, the 
framers went to great lengths to guarantee a degree of 
judicial independence for future generations that they 
themselves had not experienced.  Under the Constitution, 
2 OIL STATES ENERGY SERVICES, LLC v. GREENE’SENERGY GROUP, LLC 
GORSUCH, J., dissenting
judges “hold their Offices during good Behaviour” and 
their “Compensation . . . shall not be diminished during 
the[ir] Continuance in Office.”  Art. III, §1.  The framers 
knew that “a fixed provision” for judges’ financial support 
would help secure “the independence of the judges,” be-
cause “a power over a man’s subsistence amounts to a 
power over his will.”  The Federalist No. 79, p. 472 (C. 
Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (emphasis deleted).  They 
were convinced, too, that “[p]eriodical appointments, 
however regulated, or by whomsoever made, would, in 
some way or other, be fatal to [the courts’] necessary inde-
pendence.”  The Federalist No. 78, at 471 (A. Hamilton).Today, the government invites us to retreat from the 
promise of judicial independence.  Until recently, most 
everyone considered an issued patent a personal right—no 
less than a home or farm—that the federal government 
could revoke only with the concurrence of independent 
judges.  But in the statute before us Congress has tapped 
an executive agency, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, 
for the job.  Supporters say this is a good thing because 
the Patent Office issues too many low quality patents; 
allowing a subdivision of that office to clean up problems 
after the fact, they assure us, promises an efficient solu-
tion.  And, no doubt, dispensing with constitutionally 
prescribed procedures is often expedient.  Whether it is 
the guarantee of a warrant before a search, a jury trial 
before a conviction—or, yes, a judicial hearing before a 
property interest is stripped away—the Constitution’s 
constraints can slow things down.  But economy supplies 
no license for ignoring these—often vitally inefficient— 
protections.  The Constitution “reflects a judgment by the 
American people that the benefits of its restrictions on the 
Government outweigh the costs,” and it is not our place to 
replace that judgment with our own.  United States v.

Director of the Patent Office is a political appointee who 
serves at the pleasure of the President.  35 U. S. C. 
§§3(a)(1), (a)(4).  He supervises and pays the Board mem-
bers responsible for deciding patent disputes.  §§1(a), 
3(b)(6), 6(a).  The Director is allowed to select which of 
these members, and how many of them, will hear any 
particular patent challenge.  See §6(c).  If they (somehow) 
reach a result he does not like, the Director can add more 
members to the panel—including himself—and order the 
case reheard.  See §§6(a), (c); In re Alappat, 33 F. 3d 1526, 
1535 (CA Fed. 1994) (en banc); Nidec Motor Corp. v.

1020 (CA Fed. 2013) (Dyk, J., concurring), cert. pending, 
No. 17–751.  Nor has the Director proven bashful about 
asserting these statutory powers to secure the “ ‘policy 
judgments’ ” he seeks.  Brief for Petitioner 46 (quoting 
Patent Office Solicitor); see also Brief for Shire Pharma-
ceuticals LLC as Amicus Curiae 22–30.No doubt this efficient scheme is well intended.  But can 
there be any doubt that it also represents a retreat from 
the promise of judicial independence?  Or that when an 
independent Judiciary gives ground to bureaucrats in the 
adjudication of cases, the losers will often prove the un-
popular and vulnerable?  Powerful interests are capable of 
amassing armies of lobbyists and lawyers to influence 
(and even capture) politically accountable bureaucracies.  
But what about everyone else?Of course, all this invites the question: how do we know 
which cases independent judges must hear?  The Constitu-
tion’s original public meaning supplies the key, for the 
Constitution cannot secure the people’s liberty any less 
today than it did the day it was ratified.  The relevant 
constitutional provision, Article III, explains that the 
federal “judicial Power” is vested in independent judges.  
As originally understood, the judicial power extended to 
“suit[s] at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty.”

part ways only on its application.1As I read the historical record presented to us, only 
courts could hear patent challenges in England at the time 
of the founding.  If facts were in dispute, the matter first 
had to proceed in the law courts.  See, e.g., Newsham v. 
Gray, 2 Atk. 286, 26 Eng. Rep. 575 (Ch. 1742).  If success-
ful there, a challenger then had to obtain a writ of scire

that the political branches may “depart from the requirements of 
Article III” when the benefits outweigh the costs.  Id., at 851.  Color me 
skeptical.  The very point of our written Constitution was to prevent 
the government from “depart[ing]” from its protections for the people

outweigh the benefits.  See United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. 460, 470

exist.  Mossoff, Rethinking Patents 1288–1289.  The Con-
stitution itself reflects this new thinking, authorizing the

viewing a patent as a contract between the crown and the 
patentee to viewing it as a ‘social contract’ between the

patents came to be seen so differently, it is no surprise

effort to override a patent on munitions during wartime, 
no doubt in an effort to increase their supply.  But even 
then appealing to the Privy Council was seen as a last 
resort.  The 1779 petition (the last Privy Council revoca-
tion ever) came only after the patentee twice refused 
instructions to litigate the patent’s validity in a court of 
law.  Gómez-Arostegui & Bottomley, Privy Council and 
Scire Facias 1700–1883, p. 6 (Nov. 6, 2017) 
https://ssrn.com/abstract=3054989 (citing Board of Ord-
nance v. Wilkinson, PC2/123 (1779), and PC1/11/150

instead referred it to the Attorney General where it ap-
pears to have been abandoned.  Gómez-Arostegui & Bot-
tomley, Privy Council and Scire Facias, supra, at 17–18.  
Meanwhile, in response to the 1810 petition the Attorney 
General admitted that scire facias was the “usual manner” 
of revoking a patent and so directed the petitioner to 
proceed at law even as he suggested the Privy Council 
might be available in the event of a “very pressing and 
imminent” danger to the public.  Id., at 20 (citing 
PC1/3919 (1810)).In the end, these cases do very little to support the 
Court’s holding.  At most, they suggest that the Privy 
Council might have possessed some residual power to 
revoke patents to address wartime necessities.  Equally, 
they might serve only as more unfortunate evidence of the 
maxim that in time of war, the laws fall silent.5  But

5 After all, the English statute of monopolies appeared to require the 
“force and validitie” of all patents to be determined only by “the Comon 
Lawes of this Realme & not otherwise.”  21 Jac. 1, c. 3, §2 (1624).  So 
the Privy Council cases on which the Court relies may not reflect the 
best understanding of the British constitution.

whatever they do, these cases do not come close to proving 
that patent disputes were routinely permitted to proceed 
outside a court of law.Any lingering doubt about English law is resolved for 
me by looking to our own.  While the Court is correct that 
the Constitution’s Patent Clause “ ‘was written against the 
backdrop’ ” of English practice, ante, at 14 (quoting Gra-
ham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1, 5 
(1966)), it’s also true that the Clause sought to reject some 
of early English practice.  Reflecting the growing senti-
ment that patents shouldn’t be used for anticompetitive 
monopolies over “goods or businesses which had long 
before been enjoyed by the public,” the framers wrote the 
Clause to protect only procompetitive invention patents 
that are the product of hard work and insight and “add to 
the sum of useful knowledge.”  Id., at 5–6.  In light of the 
Patent Clause’s restrictions on this score, courts took the 
view that when the federal government “grants a patent 
the grantee is entitled to it as a matter of right, and does 
not receive it, as was originally supposed to be the case in 
England, as a matter of grace and favor.”  James v. Camp-
bell, 104 U. S. 356, 358 (1882) (emphasis added).  As Chief 
Justice Marshall explained, courts treated American 
invention patents as recognizing an “inchoate property” 
that exists “from the moment of invention.”  Evans v. 
Jordan, 8 F. Cas. 872, 873 (No. 4,564) (CC Va. 1813).  
American patent holders thus were thought to “hol[d] a 
property in [their] invention[s] by as good a title as the 
farmer holds his farm and flock.”  Hovey v. Henry, 12 F. 
Cas. 603, 604 (No. 6,742) (CC Mass. 1846) (Woodbury, J.).  
And just as with farm and flock, it was widely accepted 
that the government could divest patent owners of their 
rights only through proceedings before independent judges.This view held firm for most of our history.  In fact, from 
the time it established the American patent system in 
1790 until about 1980, Congress left the job of invalidatingCite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018) 9

patents at the federal level to courts alone.  The only 
apparent exception to this rule cited to us was a 4 year 
period when foreign patentees had to “work” or commer-
cialize their patents or risk having them revoked.  
Hovenkamp, The Emergence of Classical American Patent 
Law, 58 Ariz. L. Rev. 263, 283–284 (2016).  And the fact 
that for almost 200 years “earlier Congresses avoided use 
of [a] highly attractive”—and surely more efficient—
means for extinguishing patents should serve as good 
“reason to believe that the power was thought not to exist” 
at the time of the founding.  Printz v. United States, 521 
U. S. 898, 905 (1997).One more episode still underscores the point.  When the 
Executive sought to claim the right to cancel a patent in 
the 1800s, this Court firmly rebuffed the effort.  The Court 
explained: 
“It has been settled by repeated decisions of this court 
that when a patent has [been issued by] the Patent 
Office, it has passed beyond the control and jurisdic-
tion of that office, and is not subject to be revoked or 
cancelled by the President, or any other officer of the 
Government.  It has become the property of the pa-
tentee, and as such is entitled to the same legal pro-
tection as other property.”  McCormick Harvesting 
Machine Co. v. Aultman, 169 U. S. 606, 608–609 
(1898) (citations omitted). 
As a result, the Court held, “[t]he only authority compe-
tent to set a patent aside, or to annul it, or to correct it for 
any reason whatever, is vested in the courts of the United 
States, and not in the department which issued the pat- 
ent.”  Id., at 609.The Court today replies that McCormick sought only to 
interpret certain statutes then in force, not the Constitu-
tion.  Ante, at 11, and n. 3.  But this much is hard to see.  
Allowing the Executive to withdraw a patent, McCormick

said, “would be to deprive the applicant of his property 
without due process of law, and would be in fact an inva-
sion of the judicial branch of the government by the execu-
tive.”  169 U. S., at 612.  McCormick also pointed to “re-
peated decisions” in similar cases that themselves do not 
seem to rest merely on statutory grounds.  See id., at 608–
609 (citing United States v. Schurz, 102 U. S. 378 (1880), 
and United States v. American Bell Telephone Co., 128 
U. S. 315 (1888)).  And McCormick equated invention 
patents with land patents.  169 U. S., at 609.  That is 
significant because, while the Executive has always dis-
pensed public lands to homesteaders and other private 
persons, it has never been constitutionally empowered to 
withdraw land patents from their recipients (or their 
successors-in-interest) except through a “judgment of a 
court.” United States v. Stone, 2 Wall. 525, 535 (1865); 
Wellness Int’l Network, Ltd. v. Sharif, 575 U. S. ___, ___ 
(2015) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 11) (“Although 
Congress could authorize executive agencies to dispose of 
public rights in lands—often by means of adjudicating a 
claimant’s qualifications for a land grant under a stat-
ute—the United States had to go to the courts if it wished 
to revoke a patent” (emphasis deleted)).With so much in the relevant history and precedent 
against it, the Court invites us to look elsewhere.  Instead 
of focusing on the revocation of patents, it asks us to ab-
stract the level of our inquiry and focus on their issuance.  
Because the job of issuing invention patents traditionally 
belonged to the Executive, the Court proceeds to argue, 
the job of revoking them can be left there too.  Ante, at 6–
10.  But that doesn’t follow.  Just because you give a gift 
doesn’t mean you forever enjoy the right to reclaim it.  
And, as we’ve seen, just because the Executive could issue 
an invention (or land) patent did not mean the Executive 
could revoke it.  To reward those who had proven the social 
utility of their work (and to induce others to follow suit),Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018) 11

the law long afforded patent holders more protection than 
that against the threat of governmental intrusion and 
dispossession.  The law requires us to honor those histori-
cal rights, not diminish them.Still, the Court asks us to look away in yet another 
direction.  At the founding, the Court notes, the Executive 
could sometimes both dispense and revoke public fran-
chises.  And because, it says, invention patents are a 
species of public franchises, the Court argues the Execu-
tive should be allowed to dispense and revoke them too.  
Ante, at 9–10.   But labels aside, by the time of the found-
ing the law treated patents protected by the Patent Clause 
quite differently from ordinary public franchises.  Many 
public franchises amounted to little more than favors 
resembling the original royal patents the framers expressly 
refused to protect in the Patent Clause.  The Court points 
to a good example: the state-granted exclusive right to 
operate a toll bridge.  Ante, at 9.  By the founding, courts 
in this country (as in England) had come to view anticom-
petitive monopolies like that with disfavor, narrowly 
construing the rights they conferred.  See Proprietors of 
Charles River Bridge v. Proprietors of Warren Bridge, 11 
Pet. 420, 544 (1837).  By contrast, courts routinely applied 
to invention patents protected by the Patent Clause the 
“liberal common sense construction” that applies to other 
instruments creating private property rights, like land 
deeds.  Davis v. Palmer, 7 F. Cas. 154, 158 (No. 3,645) (CC 
Va. 1827) (Marshall, C. J.); see also Mossoff, Reevaluating 
the Patent Privilege 990 (listing more differences in 
treatment).  As Justice Story explained, invention patents 
protected by the Patent Clause were “not to be treated as 
mere monopolies odious in the eyes of the law, and there-
fore not to be favored.”  Ames v. Howard, 1 F. Cas. 755, 
756 (No. 326) (CC Mass. 1833).  For precisely these rea-
sons and as we’ve seen, the law traditionally treated pat- 
ents issued under the Patent Clause very differently than

GORSUCH, J., dissenting
monopoly franchises when it came to governmental inva-
sions.  Patents alone required independent judges.  Nor 
can simply invoking a mismatched label obscure that fact.  
The people’s historic rights to have independent judges 
decide their disputes with the government should not be a 
“constitutional Maginot Line, easily circumvented” by 
such “simpl[e] maneuver[s].” Bank Markazi v. Peterson, 
578 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting) (slip 
op., at 12).Today’s decision may not represent a rout but it at least 
signals a retreat from Article III’s guarantees.  Ceding to 
the political branches ground they wish to take in the 
name of efficient government may seem like an act of 
judicial restraint.  But enforcing Article III isn’t about 
protecting judicial authority for its own sake.  It’s about 
ensuring the people today and tomorrow enjoy no fewer 
rights against governmental intrusion than those who 
came before.  And the loss of the right to an independent 
judge is never a small thing.  It’s for that reason Hamilton 
warned the judiciary to take “all possible care . . . to de-
fend itself against” intrusions by the other branches.  The 
Federalist No. 78, at 466.  It’s for that reason I respectfully 
dissent.
