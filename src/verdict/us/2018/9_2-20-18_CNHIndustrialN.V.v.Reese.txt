SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
CNH INDUSTRIAL N.V., ET AL. v. JACK REESE, ET AL. 
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
 
No. 17–515. Decided February 20, 2018 PER CURIAM. 
Three Terms ago, this Court’s decision in M&G Poly-
mers USA, LLC v. Tackett, 574 U. S. ___ (2015), held that 
the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit was required to
interpret collective-bargaining agreements according to
“ordinary principles of contract law.” Id., at ___ (slip op., 
at 1). Before Tackett, the Sixth Circuit applied a series of 
“Yard-Man inferences,” stemming from its decision in 
International Union, United Auto, Aerospace, & Agricul-
tural Implement Workers of Am. v. Yard-Man, Inc., 716 F. 
2d 1476 (1983).  In accord with the Yard-Man inferences, 
courts presumed, in a variety of circumstances, that 
collective-bargaining agreements vested retiree benefits 
for life. See Tackett, 574 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 7– 
10). But Tackett “reject[ed]” these inferences “as incon-
sistent with ordinary principles of contract law.”  Id., at 
___ (slip op., at 14). 
In this case, the Sixth Circuit held that the same Yard-
Man inferences it once used to presume lifetime vesting 
can now be used to render a collective-bargaining agree-
ment ambiguous as a matter of law, thus allowing courts 
to consult extrinsic evidence about lifetime vesting. 854 
F. 3d 877, 882–883 (2017).  This analysis cannot be 
squared with Tackett. A contract is not ambiguous unless
it is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, 
and the Yard-Man inferences cannot generate a reason-
able interpretation because they are not “ordinary princi-
ples of contract law,” Tackett, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 14). 
Because the Sixth Circuit’s analysis is “Yard-Man re-born,

re-built, and re-purposed for new adventures,” 854 F. 3d, 
at 891 (Sutton, J., dissenting), we reverse. 
I A This Court has long held that collective-bargaining 
agreements must be interpreted “according to ordinary
principles of contract law.”  Tackett, 574 U. S., at ___ (slip 
op., at 7) (citing Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 
353 U. S. 448, 456–457 (1957)).  Prior to Tackett, the Sixth
Circuit purported to follow this rule, but it used a unique 
series of “Yard-Man inferences” that no other circuit ap-
plied. 574 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). For example, the
Sixth Circuit presumed that “a general durational clause” 
in a collective-bargaining agreement “ ‘says nothing about 
the vesting of retiree benefits’ ” in that agreement.  Id., at 
___–___ (slip op., at 9–10) (quoting Noe v. PolyOne Corp., 
520 F. 3d 548, 555 (CA6 2008)).  If the collective-
bargaining agreement lacked “a termination provision
specifically addressing retiree benefits” but contained 
specific termination provisions for other benefits, the Sixth
Circuit presumed that the retiree benefits vested for life. 
Tackett, supra, at ___–___ (slip op., at 7–8) (citing Yard-
Man, supra, at 1480). The Sixth Circuit also presumed 
vesting if “a provision . . . ‘tie[d] eligibility for retirement-
health benefits to eligibility for a pension.”  574 U. S., at
___ (slip op., at 10) (quoting Noe, supra, at 558).
This Court’s decision in Tackett “reject[ed] the Yard-
Man inferences as inconsistent with ordinary principles of 
contract law.”  574 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).  Most 
obviously, the Yard-Man inferences erroneously “refused
to apply general durational clauses to provisions govern-
ing retiree benefits.”  574 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). 
This refusal “distort[ed] the text of the agreement and
conflict[ed] with the principle of contract law that the 
written agreement is presumed to encompass the whole

Per Curiam
agreement of the parties.” Ibid.
 The Yard-Man inferences also incorrectly inferred life-
time vesting whenever “a contract is silent as to the dura-
tion of retiree benefits.”  574 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14). 
The “traditional principle,” Tackett explained, is that
“ ‘contractual obligations will cease, in the ordinary course, 
upon termination of the bargaining agreement.’ ” Id., at 
___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting Litton Financial Printing 
Div., Litton Business Systems, Inc. v. NLRB, 501 U. S.
190, 207 (1991)).  “[C]ontracts that are silent as to their 
duration will ordinarily be treated not as ‘operative in
perpetuity’ but as ‘operative for a reasonable time.’ ” 574
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting 3 A. Corbin, Corbin 
on Contracts §553, p. 216 (1960)).  In fact, the Sixth Cir-
cuit had followed this principle in cases involving noncol-
lectively bargained agreements, see Sprague v. General 
Motors Corp., 133 F. 3d 388, 400 (1998) (en banc), which 
“only underscore[d] Yard-Man’s deviation from ordinary 
principles of contract law.”  Tackett, supra, at ___ (slip op., 
at 13).
As for the tying of retiree benefits to pensioner status,
Tackett rejected this Yard-Man inference as “contrary to 
Congress’ determination” in the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat. 891.  574
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). The Sixth Circuit adopted 
this inference on the assumption that retiree health bene-
fits are “ ‘a form of delayed compensation or reward for
past services,’ ” like a pension.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4) 
(quoting Yard-Man, supra, at 1482). But ERISA distin-
guishes between plans that “resul[t] in a deferral of in-
come,” §1002(2)(A)(ii), and plans that offer medical bene-
fits, §1002(1)(A).  See Tackett, 574 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 
11). Tackett thus concluded that this and the other “infer-
ences applied in Yard-Man and its progeny” do not “repre-
sent ordinary principles of contract law.” Id., at ___ (slip
op., at 10).

Like Tackett, this case involves a dispute between retir-
ees and their former employer about whether an expired 
collective-bargaining agreement created a vested right to
lifetime health care benefits.  In 1998, CNH Industrial
N. V. and CNH Industrial America LLC (collectively,
CNH) agreed to a collective-bargaining agreement.  The 
1998 agreement provided health care benefits under a 
group benefit plan to certain “[e]mployees who retire
under the . . . Pension Plan.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. A–116.
“All other coverages,” such as life insurance, ceased upon 
retirement. Ibid.  The group benefit plan was “made part
of ” the collective-bargaining agreement and “r[an] concur-
rently” with it.  Id., at A–114. The 1998 agreement con-
tained a general durational clause stating that it would 
terminate in May 2004.  Id., at A–115.  The agreement 
also stated that it “dispose[d] of any and all bargaining 
issues, whether or not presented during negotiations.”
Ibid.
When the 1998 agreement expired in 2004, a class of
CNH retirees and surviving spouses (collectively, the
retirees) filed this lawsuit, seeking a declaration that their 
health care benefits vested for life and an injunction pre-
venting CNH from changing them.  While their lawsuit 
was pending, this Court decided Tackett. Based on Tack-
ett, the District Court initially awarded summary judg-
ment to CNH. But after reconsideration, it awarded 
summary judgment to the retirees.  143 F. Supp. 3d 609
(ED Mich. 2015). 
The Sixth Circuit affirmed in relevant part.  854 F. 3d, 
at 879. The court began by noting that the 1998 agree-
ment was “silent” on whether health care benefits vested 
for life. Id., at 882. Although the agreement contained a
general durational clause, the Sixth Circuit found that
clause inconclusive for two reasons. First, the 1998
agreement “carved out certain benefits” like life insurance
   
5 Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018) 
Per Curiam
“and stated that those coverages ceased at a time different
than other provisions.” Ibid.; see App. to Pet. for Cert. A– 
116. Second, the 1998 agreement “tied” health care bene-
fits to pension eligibility.  854 F. 3d, at 882; see App. to 
Pet. for Cert. A–116. These conditions rendered the 1998
agreement ambiguous, according to the Sixth Circuit,
which allowed it to consult extrinsic evidence. 854 F. 3d,
at 883. And that evidence supported lifetime vesting. 
Ibid.  The Sixth Circuit acknowledged that these features 
of the agreement are the same ones it used to “infer vest-
ing” under Yard-Man, but it concluded that nothing in
Tackett precludes this kind of analysis: “There is surely a 
difference between finding ambiguity from silence and 
finding vesting from silence.” 854 F. 3d, at 882.1 
Judge Sutton dissented. See id., at 887–893. He con-
cluded that the 1998 agreement was unambiguous be-
cause “the company never promised to provide healthcare 
benefits for life, and the agreement contained a durational 
clause that limited all of the benefits.” Id., at 888. Judge
Sutton noted that, in finding ambiguity, the panel major- 
ity relied on the same inferences that this Court proscribed 
in Tackett. See 854 F. 3d, at 890–891.  But ambiguity, he
explained, requires “two competing interpretations, both
of which are fairly plausible,” id., at 890, and “[a] forbid-
den inference cannot generate a plausible reading,” id., at
891. The panel majority’s contrary decision, Judge Sutton
concluded, “abrad[ed] an inter-circuit split (and an intra-
circuit split) that the Supreme Court just sutured shut.”
Id., at 890.2 
—————— 
1 After accepting the retirees’ reading of the 1998 agreement, the 
Sixth Circuit remanded for the District Court to reconsider the reason-
ableness of CNH’s proposed modifications to the health care benefits.
See 854 F. 3d 877, 884–887 (2017).  CNH does not challenge that
determination, and we express no view on it. 
2 By “intra-circuit split,” Judge Sutton was referring to the Sixth 
Circuit’s earlier decision in Gallo v. Moen Inc., 813 F. 3d 265 (2016).

The decision below does not comply with Tackett’s direc-
tion to apply ordinary contract principles.  True, one such
principle is that, when a contract is ambiguous, courts can 
consult extrinsic evidence to determine the parties’ inten-
tions. See 574 U. S., at ___ (GINSBURG, J., concurring) 
(slip op., at 1) (citing 11 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts
§30:7, pp. 116–124 (4th ed. 2012) (Williston)).  But a con-
tract is not ambiguous unless, “after applying established 
rules of interpretation, [it] remains reasonably susceptible
to at least two reasonable but conflicting meanings.”  Id., 
§30:4, at 53–54 (footnote omitted). Here, that means the 
1998 agreement was not ambiguous unless it could rea-
sonably be read as vesting health care benefits for life.
The Sixth Circuit read it that way only by employing the
inferences that this Court rejected in Tackett. The Sixth 
Circuit did not point to any explicit terms, implied terms,
or industry practice suggesting that the 1998 agreement 
vested health care benefits for life.  Cf. 574 U. S., at ___
(GINSBURG, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2).  Instead, it 
found ambiguity in the 1998 agreement by applying sev-
eral of the Yard-Man inferences: It declined to apply the
general durational clause to the health care benefits, and
then it inferred vesting from the presence of specific ter-
—————— 
That decision concluded that a collective-bargaining agreement did not 
vest health care benefits for life, relying on the general durational 
clause and rejecting the same inferences that the Sixth Circuit invoked 
here. See id., at 269–272. The conflict between these decisions, and
others like them, has led one judge in the Sixth Circuit to declare that
“[o]ur post-Tackett case law is a mess.”  International Union, United 
Auto, Aerospace & Agricultural Implement Workers of Am. v. Kelsey-
Hayes Co., 872 F. 3d 388, 390 (2017) (Griffin, J., dissenting from denial
of rehearing en banc).  To date, the en banc Sixth Circuit has been
unwilling (or unable) to reconcile its precedents.  See ibid. (Sutton, J.,
concurring in denial of rehearing en banc) (agreeing that this conflict 
“warrants en banc review” but voting against it because “there is a real
possibility that we would not have nine votes for any one [approach]”).

mination provisions for other benefits and the tying of 
health care benefits to pensioner status. 
Tackett rejected those inferences precisely because they 
are not “established rules of interpretation,” 11 Williston 
§30:4, at 53–54.  The Yard-Man inferences “distort the 
text of the agreement,” fail “to apply general durational 
clauses,” erroneously presume lifetime vesting from si-
lence, and contradict how “Congress specifically defined” 
key terms in ERISA.  Tackett, 574 U. S., at ___–___ (slip
op., at 11–14). Tackett thus rejected these inferences not
because of the consequences that the Sixth Circuit at-
tached to them—presuming vesting versus finding ambi-
guity—but because they are not a valid way to read a
contract. They cannot be used to create a reasonable 
interpretation any more than they can be used to create a
presumptive one.
Tellingly, no other Court of Appeals would find ambigu-
ity in these circumstances.  When a collective-bargaining
agreement is merely silent on the question of vesting, 
other courts would conclude that it does not vest benefits 
for life.3  Similarly, when an agreement does not specify a 
duration for health care benefits in particular, other
courts would simply apply the general durational clause.4 
And other courts would not find ambiguity from the tying 
of retiree benefits to pensioner status.5  The approach
taken in these other decisions “only underscores” how the

decision below “deviat[ed] from ordinary principles of 
contract law.”  Tackett, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 13).Shorn of Yard-Man inferences, this case is straightfor-
ward.  The 1998 agreement contained a general durational
clause that applied to all benefits, unless the agreement 
specified otherwise. No provision specified that the health 
care benefits were subject to a different durational clause. 
The agreement stated that the health benefits plan “r[an] 
concurrently” with the collective-bargaining agreement,
tying the health care benefits to the duration of the rest of 
the agreement. App. to Pet. for Cert. A–114. If the parties
meant to vest health care benefits for life, they easily
could have said so in the text.  But they did not. And they
specified that their agreement “dispose[d] of any and all
bargaining issues” between them.  Id., at A–115.  Thus, 
the only reasonable interpretation of the 1998 agree- 
ment is that the health care benefits expired when the
collective-bargaining agreement expired in May 2004. 
“When the intent of the parties is unambiguously ex-
pressed in the contract, that expression controls, and the
court’s inquiry should proceed no further.” Tackett, supra, 
at ___ (GINSBURG, J., concurring) (slip op., at 1) (citing 11
Williston §30:6, at 98–104).

Because the decision below is not consistent with Tack-
ett, the petition for a writ of certiorari and the motions for
leave to file briefs amici curiae are granted. We reverse
the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
It is so ordered.
